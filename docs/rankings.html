<p id="rankpar"> I didn't start seriously watching movies until Jan. 1, 2017, when I began keeping a record of every movie I had seen in a running note on my phone.
      After that, I had to keep watching movies! But which ones? Soon, I was learning of the "auteurs" — Stanley Kubrick, Lars von Trier, the Coppolas. 
      It wasn't until I had come across David Lynch, however, that I had felt I found something magical. Something truly <em>me</em>. Since I have seen 
      every David Lynch movie (save just one), I thought it might be fruitful to list out my rankings of his work with a short description of how I feel about it.

    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      The Straight Story is the only David Lynch movie I haven&#39;t seen, so it must be at the bottom. It&#39;s the only movie he made for Disney, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s quite heartwarming. I&#39;ll get to it one day.

      <h3>9. <a href="movies/Dune.html">Dune</a></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Dune is probably Lynch&#39;s most infamous film. It&#39;s one he&#39;s personally disavowed. Coming after the cult success of Eraserhead and the mainstream success of The Elephant Man, Dune was simply too big a project for Lynch to handle. I still think it has some interesting moments. It definitely has more character than the most recent adaptation, but in comparison to the rest of Lynch&#39;s ouevre, this one just doesn&#39;t have the same charm.

    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Wild At Heart is a funky movie. Trust me, I love Laura Dern and Nicolas Cage as much as the next guy, but this thing is gory and sex-crazed and hopping all over the walls throughout its 2 hr runtime. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen it, but its ending is still burned onto my skull. A great watch, probably not a good intro to Lynch.

    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      The Elephant Man is Lynch&#39;s most ~normal~ film in my opinion. It follows a traditional yet heart-rending and soft-spoken narrative about a man so completely misunderstood by the rest of the world. This movie got Lynch a great amount of attention early on in his career, earning his first Academy Award nominations. It&#39;s definitely great, but there&#39;s something about Lynch&#39;s more experimental side that interests me.

    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Eraserhead was Lynch&#39;s first film. Completed on a tiny budget on the lot of the American Film Institute, it somehow still has the scope and feeling of a big-budget movie. Lynch&#39;s adept skill at prosthetics and mood is on full display here. It is slow, yet you can&#39;t wrench your eyes away from the screen. It will always hold a special place in my heart — a beacon of inspiration telling me that I could make beautiful things whenever I put my mind to it.

      <h3>5. <a href="movies/LostHighway.html">Lost Highway</a></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Lost Highway probably scared me the most on first watch. The whole premise is terrifying — being seen and filmed when you don&#39;t know it. There&#39;s a particular scene near the middle of the film where Robert Loggia&#39;s character talks to Bill Pullman at a party, and you just have to see it for yourself. My mouth was agape when I first saw it. The politics of the movie are pretty interesting. A lot of Lynch&#39;s work centers on female suffering in what I think are thoughtful and respectful ways, but this movie is a little gratuitious. Maybe it just reflects the characters&#39; horrifying personalities? Not sure, but this movie marks the beginning of my favorite Lynch era.

      <h3>4. <a href="movies/TwinPeaksFireWalkWithMe.html">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</a></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me has a higher barrier of entry than the other movies on this list since it requires having watched Lynch&#39;s TV show (one of my all-time favorites) Twin Peaks. Still, this movie touches on universal themes like the corruption of innocence in a way that is more complex and satisfying than other films. Sheryl Lee&#39;s Laura Palmer, the film&#39;s protagonist, isn&#39;t the eternally innocent woman. She&#39;s complex, confused, and wants what we all want, but she&#39;s not scared to show it. You should definitely watch Twin Peaks anyway, but this movie is essential viewing once you do.

      <h3>3. <a href="movies/BlueVelvet.html">Blue Velvet</a></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Blue Velvet is Lynch&#39;s most famous movie and there is a reason for that. Though it&#39;s narrative is more linear a la Elephant Man, there are still the experimental and weird notes that mark Lynch&#39;s style. From the severed ear to beatles to women dancing on cars, this movie is an offbeat exploration of love, gender, and sexual violence. It&#39;s about the seedy underbelly of American culture, where nothing is what it seems. It&#39;s an indictment far beyond the scope of the movie, and that complexity under the surface is what draws audiences back for more. Kyle MacLachlan, Laura Dern, Isabella Rosselini, and Dennis Hooper all give stellar performances. You&#39;ll finish this movie feeling queasy, but with the sensation that you&#39;ve seen something magical. I promise.

      <h3>2. <a href="movies/MulhollandDrive.html">Mulholland Drive</a></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Mulholland Drive was my favorite Lynch film for a long time. It first changed my life on March 12, 2018. I was 17 and I had only heard it was a lesbian romance that revels in the darkness of Hollywood. Yes, it is that, yet so much more. It&#39;s narrative is a little linear, but the midpoint of the movie absolutely switches gears and the audience is left to interpret what the film&#39;s dual nature means. I love that the movie doesn&#39;t offer answers. There are tiny old people, and a magical homeless women who controls dreams, and a studio exec who is really particular about espresso. It&#39;s weird like most of Lynch&#39;s work, but in a way that aches with love and passion. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring have magical energy that subsumes the viewer. I had the opportunity to watch this in theaters last year for the first time, and it was like seeing it for the first time again. I was having a bad day that day, and I left the theatre with a renewed love of people, the world, and art. I hope it can have the same effect on you.

      <h3>1. <a href="movies/InlandEmpire.html">Inland Empire</a></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="rankrow2">
      Inland Empire is not only my favorite Lynch movie, but it comfortably resides within my top 5 movies of all time (though Mulholland Drive doesn&#39;t lag that far behind either). This is Lynch&#39;s most recent film, and it&#39;s unclear whether he&#39;ll make another one, but if this is his last, it is surely his magnum opus. To be honest, this isn&#39;t the easiest watch. It&#39;s three hours long, and once the movie really gets going, it starts opening new layers into the narrative that leave you wondering what&#39;s happening. As you can imagine, I&#39;m generally against &#39;understanding&#39; movies. Inland Empire is an experience that I think has a lot to say under its complex surface. Like some of Lynch&#39;s other films, it&#39;s about womanhood and Hollywood. Hollywood is a machine that eats up Laura Dern, splits her identity and sense of self in every which way, and then spits her out broken. It&#39;s brutal. There is violence, and overly long shots of people walking, and weird graphics, and talking rabbits, but once the credits roll, I feel like I&#39;ve seen a truly great piece of art. I watched it three times in one week during a theatrical run at Austin Film Society. 9 hours of my life were spent watching this movie, and I would never give them back. You truly have to see it to believe it.
