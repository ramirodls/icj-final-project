  <h1 class="other-titles">Personal Rankings</h1>
  <p> I didn't start seriously watching movies until Jan. 1, 2017, when I began keeping a record of every movie I had seen in a running note on my phone.
      After that, I had to keep watching movies! But which ones? Soon, I was learning of the "auteurs" â€” Stanley Kubrick, Lars von Trier, the Coppolas. 
      It wasn't until I had come across David Lynch, however, that I had felt I found something magical. Something truly <em>me</em>. Since I have seen 
      every David Lynch movie (save just one), I thought it might be fruitful to list out my rankings of his work with a short description of how I feel about it.
